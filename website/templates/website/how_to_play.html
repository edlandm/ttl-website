<h2>How To Play</h2>
<div class="main-centered">
    <p>Go to <a href="{% url 'website:venues' %}">one of your favorite TTL venues</a>.

    Get seated and your host will set you up with team materials shortly
    before the game starts. Your host will then give you categories and ask
    the first question of the round. For each question, your team will have
    one song's worth of time to fill out and turn in your answer slip. Each
    answer slip needs a team name, an answer, and a point wager. If you get
    the question right, you earn your wager. If you miss it, it's just a zero
    no negative points (because we like to stay positive).  A perfect game is
    a bit of a long shot, but if you wager wisely, you stand a very good
    chance of winning. We like to put you in charge of the points so that you
    can control your own destiny.
