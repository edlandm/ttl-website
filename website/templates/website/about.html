    <h2>For Players</h2>
    <p>Trivia Time Live (TTL) is the Pacific Northwest’s unrivaled live trivia
    experience! The questions are generated from a secret fortress in an
    undisclosed location (somewhere near the Puget Sound). Would you like
    something besides the game on TV to keep you occupied at your favorite bar
    or restaurant? Maybe the dry or “rapid fire” trivia just isn't
    cutting it. Well, TTL offers very accessible trivia, as the engaging host
    cranks out great music (occasionally as hints for a given question), time
    is allotted for interacting with your team, and food/drink specials are
    thrown your way at various venues, and before you know it, you’re having
    the best night of your week! TTL is a fantastic night out with friends,
    a great place to meet new people, it's even a fun ice-breaker for a first
    date. That said, wolfpacks of one are always welcome. The best part – It’s
    FREE to play, so you have nothing to lose, and you win prizes if you
    finish among the top teams!</p>

    <h2>For Bar/Restaurant Owners</h2>
    <p>Thinking about whether or not you want to bring us in to do a night for
    you? Do it! You’ll want us because we bring people in the door on nights
    where that can be a challenge. Better yet, we get them coming back every
    week and making it their regular night out to eat, drink, and enjoy your
    establishment. Trivia Time Live charges very reasonable prices for the
    service of running a two-hour party in your venue that helps your bottom
    line and keeps customers happy and coming back for more!</p>

    <h2>Private Events</h2>
    <p>A Trivia Time Live game is an ideal interactive addition for your
    private event. We can tailor questions, games, and the music, to your
    specific event’s wants and needs. Whether it’s a wedding rehearsal dinner,
    a corporate icebreaker or conference, or even just a private house party,
    TTL provides a fun, engaging way for the guests and participants to mix,
    mingle, and compete in a reasonably paced, fun game of general knowledge.
    Our games will make you think, make you laugh, and make you wish it could
    go on longer, where no one is on the spot, but everyone can get involved
    and have a great time! Contact us for rates and more information.</p>
